# games #

Plan to write some classical games just for a practice of the fancy algorithms I learned or heard before.

## Checker ##

This is an implementation of American checkers played on an 8x8 checker board.

NB: 1) Usually the player with light pieces moves first, my implementation supports
choice of who moves first; 2) Capturing is mandatory in most official rules, to add
freedom, my implementation can choose whether 'force-jump'; 3) multiple jump and backward
capture is supported; 4) Do not support flying kings... too messy.

For more information, please refer to [Draughts] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draughts).

As to AI, I implementated the [minimax search] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimax) with
[Alphaâ€“beta pruning] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha-beta_pruning). 

## Mandelbrot ##

Plan to implement [Mandelbrot set] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).
